This repository is to get the ball rolling and will likely be renamed/migrated a few times.

If you have reached this point you are either at the end of a very long rabbit hole finding the first commit, or you have been wildly misled.

So please, go away and look at later commmits. Or if you are here when we just made this repo, still go away because we already don't know what we're doing and adding another cook to the pot will likely only make it harder.
