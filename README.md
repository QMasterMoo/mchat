# NOTE:
In pursuit of better performance we have moved our core to c++/boost. The biggest reason for this is c++ amazes us at how fast it is and will likely provide better performance. This will also make the project a good bit more difficult but that's why we're doing it in the first place - to learn. This repo will be archived so no further changes can be made. Hopefully it'll be a fun relic to look back upon after we are messaging each other.





# mchat
mchat is an HTTP based chat server. we do not like our current groupchat app. 9/15 members study computers. solution is to make a new app. 

# goal
make a chat API that enables us to create clients on any system that enables HTTP.

# why the name?
I don't know where the M came from originally but we've always held onto it.
