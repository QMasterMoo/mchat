# mchat
mchat is an HTTP based chat server. we do not like our current groupchat app. 9/15 members study computers. solution is to make a new app. 

# goal
make a chat API that enables us to create clients on any system that enables HTTP.

# why the name?
I don't know where the M came from originally but we've always held onto it.
